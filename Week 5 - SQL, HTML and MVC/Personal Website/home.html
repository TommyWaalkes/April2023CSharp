    <br />
    <p>My name is Justin Jones. I started programming in high school, but it wasn't a very good class. I knew I wanted to do it though and went to college for it.</p>
    <br />
    <p>As I was getting my degree, Tommy reached out to me needing a TA. I accepted, but was still in college. Realizing my degree only took me so far, I had to learn much of it on the job, usually days before I had to help teach it.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Over time, I stayed with Grand Circus. I left for another job but came back. I got promoted to Instructor and have been teaching since.</p>
